        <h2>Why I prefer Cats over Dogs</h2>
        <p>I prefer Cats over dogs because I find cats more chill at times. Although cats can be vicious, I think it relies more on how they're treated. I like dogs too but I'm in the middle when it comes to choosing either or. Cats are fluffy and some can have no fur which is cute too; cats can land on their feet when droppe too and they twist around to land.</p>
